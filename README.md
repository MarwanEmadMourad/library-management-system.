This is bosta's library managment backend task.

This app was written in node.js.

The used db is mysql db on the default port 3306, so make sure that the mysql server is up and running on that port.

CD to the app.js directory and run the command npm install to install the needed node modules and then run node app.js to start the backend server.

Now your app is ready to accept http requests.
